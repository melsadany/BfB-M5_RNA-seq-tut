# RNA-seq Analysis for Beginners - Module 5

**Bioinformatics for Beginners Course • Fall 2024**  
*Teaching undergraduate students how to analyze RNA-seq data using SRA and Galaxy*

## Course Overview

This repository contains all teaching materials, scripts, and tutorials for Module 5 of the Bioinformatics for Beginners course. This module focuses on practical RNA-seq analysis skills using publicly available data and user-friendly tools.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this module, students will be able to:

- Retrieve RNA-seq data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA)
- Use Galaxy platform for bioinformatics analysis
- Perform quality control on sequencing data
- Align reads to reference genomes
- Quantify gene expression levels
- Identify differentially expressed genes
- Interpret and visualize RNA-seq results

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of molecular biology
- No prior programming experience required
- Computer with internet access

### Required Accounts
1. **NCBI Account** - for SRA data access
2. **Galaxy Account** - for analysis platform
3. **GitHub Account** - for accessing course materials

## Tools and Platforms

### Primary Tools
